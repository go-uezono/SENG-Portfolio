								<p>Hey! I'm Go, an undergraduate student currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science with minor in Psychology at the University of <b>Calgary</b>. I started off my school year studying Psychology, but slowly transitioned into programming over covid.</p>
								<p>Since I'm a late-comer, my coding language pool is very small - I've coded in <b>Python, Java, Assembly</b> (with a bit of <b>C</b>), and am currently learning <b>HTML</b> as I'm writing this!</p>

						<!-- Assignment 1 -->
							<article id="a1">
								<h2 class="major">Requirements</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/a1UML.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A month has passed since starting my software class, and so far, it has come to be one of my favorites. Being able to code again brought light to my motivation (since this past year and a half have been full of computational theory), albeit being rusty with Java. Content delivered in the class so far has been new – such as UML diagrams, use cases, etc. – but taking theory courses prior helped me in understanding the content a lot easier and faster, thus am really looking forward to obtaining new knowledge in future deliverables.  </p>
								<p>This first assignment allowed me to utterly understand how I, as an individual, work in a team. To lay out my strengths – I was adequate in keeping up with deadlines, addressing what/when tasks needed to be complete, and catching smaller detailed portions that may have been missed by the team. After completing our first meeting, we set soft deadlines for everyone to work on the assignment on their own first. That way, we were able to figure out similarities between our diagrams and things that one of us might have missed, as well as staying on top of things – having some leeway with time constraints. This was where I was able to take the stage – implementation of “choose not to bag” was the one that was included in mine but not the others. We were all able to combine our diagrams and come to a group consensus on what should be added/removed. Communicating our ideas and reasoning for this was handled well by everyone in the group, which made this assignment a smooth sail. </p>
								<p>In contrast to my strengths, there were several noticeable drawbacks I learnt about myself, the major one being well-reserved when we are sharing our thoughts or giving input on some phenomena. I recall myself doing my own thing often – whether that be coding, working on a question of an assignment, etc. – which makes it harder for me to get my point across. Some part of me fears being incorrect, which leads to the fear of being judged. Quite often there will be times I wait till someone else gives their first thought, which then ends up being like the idea I had in mind. In that case, I leave it at that and agree with whoever said it. Another trait I need to inherit myself is leadership. Taking on the initiative to organize a group/team is something looked for in the working industry, especially in an environment where individuals will be working in groups. Throughout this assignment, I realized I end up conforming with the group a lot, which is not bad but should not always be the case. </p>
								<p>Overall, the direction our group took on this assignment was the most optimal – it allowed us to explore our own ways of solving problems first, then reconvening and sharing our work with one another. This way, we have input on how we thought it worked, where others may think differently. It is always good to have a second opinion when you are unsure of something. This approach also really made me realize how groups operate, and how I operate in a group setting. The listed strengths will be something I will keep up for future assignments, and the weaknesses I have encountered about myself will be something I will be more aware of when I have colleagues I am working with. </p>

						<!-- Assignment 2 -->
							<article id="a2">
								<h2 class="major">Modelling</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/a2ClassDiagram.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>As we progress into the semester, material and concepts have become more tedious, making it a little harder for me to keep up with the class along with my other courses. Despite that, I have learned a lot more about the several types of diagrams that are used in modelling a program. This previous assignment revolved around how we interpret a program works via descriptions and functionality (use-case modelling) - this current assignment (second) allowed us to explore three different degrees of modelling to represent a program (structural, sequential, and state-machine). Once again, all delivered material thus far was new to me, which made it very intriguing for me to learn. </p>
								<p>Since I have touched the waters of what it is like to work in a group setting, I had expectations for myself, as well as for the peers I worked with. As for myself, I expected to step it up regarding sharing my own input and taking on a leadership role. Since I worked on the second assignment with the same group as I did with the first, things went on a smooth sail – it was easier for me to bring about my ideas since I was familiar with the people I was working with. We took on a similar approach as we did with the first assignment – divide and conquer and look over area's others needed help with. I worked on the structure diagram with another peer, which ended up being a hefty task (going through all the classes, interfaces, etc., and picking out the most important ones). This was where I took a lot of the initiative; giving my own input, structuring the diagram together, and making it organized so that it was easy to the eye. At this point, I knew things I needed to work on, which I kept conscious of. Thus, it was easier for me to utilize working on my weaknesses to improve it via the assignment.  </p>
								<p>Aside from my personal growth, we had improvements as a team – everyone was able to get stuff done on time (soft deadlines) albeit complications some of us had during the assignment (moving, exams, etc.). We communicated sections that needed to be looked over, questions that needed to be answered, coherency amongst the team was excellent, etc. Overall, our group chemistry improved since the first assignment. </p>
								<p>Although I was able to display improvements in my weaker areas, in the back of my mind, I knew I could do more. That is, taking on the leadership role a bit further. I did mention that I displayed leadership acts throughout the assignment, but that was mostly between my peer and me. I have yet to lead the team which I can hopefully show more of in the upcoming assignment. As for the next assignment, though, I hope to see actual coding for us to work on. These past assignments have just been diagrams – which are important and interesting, do not get me wrong – so I have not been able to ramp up my coding skills. </p>

						<!-- Assignment 3 -->
							<article id="a3">
								<h2 class="major">Testing</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/a3CDTest.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>As soon as we submitted our second assignment, we had to get started on our third – this did not give me a lot of time to take a step back and look at what I could have done differently/better. At this point I was a bit behind on lectures due to working on assignment two, so I had a little bit of catching up to do. Thankfully, this assignment was code-based, which is something I wanted to really improve on – keep in mind that I have not coded in Java (or in general) for a year and a half.  </p>
								<p>For this assignment – you guessed it – I worked with the same group I did for the first two assignments. We took a one-day break after finishing assignment two and reconvened later in the afternoon to chat about what to do. We decided to take the divide and conquer approach again, since a lot of us did not have time to work on it together. I took on the Coin Dispenser class/abstract/interface and I can safely say that I did a fairly good job on writing JUnit tests for the methods. This was my first-time writing a JUnit test, so it was a bit challenging. I got the hang of it after writing a few, but needed my fellow peer to look over it in case I interpreted it incorrectly. I was also able to detect a few bugs in the code – something I did not have too much experience with – which I was proud of. I am glad I was able to pull my weight for this coding assignment, and that my peers were proud of me for getting a good chunk of work done. This assignment was a steppingstone for me in my coding skills, with what I need to work on (tracing and such). </p>
								<p>Overall, as mentioned in previous reflections, the reason we keep on working together is because our chemistry has grown over time, so we know how one another functions in a group setting. I am glad we were able to work together and hope to work with these guys again for the upcoming group project. I am interested to see how 20 students are going to function in a group project. </p>
